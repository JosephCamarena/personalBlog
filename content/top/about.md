My journey to Cyber Security started with a BA in Psychology, an AS in Computer Science, and recently starting graduate school in the Fall of 2021. I'm currently enrolled in <a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">GA Tech's OMSCS</a> program, with an expected graduation date of Fall 2024. My current immediate goal is to work as a Security Engineer, with an end goal of owning my own Cyber Security company with the intent to share my business earnings to philanthropic pursuits. I have a love of taking things apart and seeing how they work, as I'm quite curious. My career interests include PenTesting, Ethical Hacking, Vulnerability Analysis, Network Security, Physical Pentesting, and Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.

This blog was created to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have accumulated on my path to a Cyber Security career, while also serving as a personal reminder of the things I've learned. Once I've achieved a career in Security Engineering, I will continue to update this blog with new knowledge I gain in the field, in the hopes that my knowledge can better serve others.

I live in Southern California, and enjoy the outdoors when I can. I'm an avid gamer, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioner, hiker, cyclist, and rock climber.
