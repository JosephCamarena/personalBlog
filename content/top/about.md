My journey to Cyber Security started with a BA in Psychology, an AS in Computer Science, and recently starting graduate school in the Fall of 2021. I'm currently enrolled in <a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">GA Tech's OMSCS</a> program, with an expected graduation date of Fall 2024. My current interests are in the areas of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and Penetration Testing, which includes privilege escalation in Linux and Windows and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).

This blog was created to showcase the skills and knowledge I have accumulated on my path to a Cyber Security career. Once I've achieved a career in Pen Testing, I will continue to update this blog with new knowledge I gain in the field.

I live in San Diego, enjoying the outdoors when I can. I'm an avid gamer, cyclist, boulderer, and hiker, with plans to train in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at <a href="https://www.victorygyms.com/" target="_blank">Victory MMA</a> here in SD.
